## [1.1.0] - 2017-05-21

### Added

* ✨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* ✨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
* ✨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code — Rollup will remove from production code.
* ✨ Now pointing unit tests at ES Modules build, not CommonJS-one. This means, unit test coverage will be correct (higher) because there won't be any missing rows that Babel added which are impossible to cover.

## 1.0.0 - 2016-12-13

### Added

* First public release
