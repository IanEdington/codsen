## Idea

Working with parsed HTML AST trees is hard when you want to go "up" the branches because all "AST-walking" algorithms rely on recursion and walk just "down", not "up". `ast-monkey`'s primary purpose is to help in those cases when you want to go _up the branches_.

`ast-monkey` algorithm assigns indexes to every traversed node so that you can visit it again. Also, [.find()](#find) will record the "bread crumb"-style indexes path to each found node. This, combined with [.get()](#get) function allows you to traverse the tree "up", from the found child node up all the way until its topmost parent node is reached.

Using this library, you can delete the particular piece of AST (method [.drop()](#drop)) or overwrite (method [.set()](#set)). You can also perform searches by object's/array's `key`, `value` or both (method [.find()](#find)). You can retrieve all contents of any piece of AST by index (method [.get()](#get)) or list all indexes (method [.info()](#info)).

Alternatively, you can tap into the core of the monkey, the [.traverse()](#traverse) function and save yourself the trouble writing recursive walk-through functions â€” the [.traverse()](#traverse) will walk through every single element of an array or key of an object, giving you the current thing via the familiar callback function interface (just like `Array.forEach` or `Array.map`).

## API

### .find()

Method `monkey.find()` can search objects/arrays by key or by value or by both and return the indexes path to an each finding.

---

**Input**

Input argument   | Type             | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|------------------|-------------|--------------
`input`          | Whatever         | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested.
`options`        | Object           | yes         | Options object. See below.

Options object's key  | Type             | Obligatory?                  | Description
----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|-------------
{                     |                  |                              |
`key`                 | String           | at least one, `key` or `val` | If you want to search by an object's key, put it here.
`val`                 | Whatever         | at least one, `key` or `val` | If you want to search by a plain object's value, put it here.
}                     |                  |                              |

Either `opts.key` or `opts.val` or both must be present. If both are missing, `ast-monkey` will throw an error.

**Output**

Output will be an array, comprising of zero or more plain objects in the following format:

Object's key     | Type             | Description
-----------------|------------------|-------------
{                |                  |
`index`          | Integer number   | The index of the finding. It's also the last element of the `path` array.
`key`            | String           | The found object's key
`val`            | Whatever or Null | The found object's value (or `null` if it's a key of an array)
`path`           | Array            | The found object's path: indexes of all its parents, starting from the topmost. The found key/value pair's address will be the last element of the `path` array.
}                |                  |

If a finding is an element of an array, the `val` will be set to `null`.

**Use example**

Find out, what is the path to the key that equals 'b'.

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var input = ['a', [['b'], 'c']]
var key = 'b'
var result = monkey.find(input, {key: key})
console.log('result = ' + JSON.stringify(result, null, 4))
// => [
//      {
//        index: 4,
//        key: 'b',
//        val: null,
//        path: [2, 3, 4]
//      }
//    ]
```

Once you know that the path is `[2, 3, 4]`, you can iterate its parents, `get()`-ing indexes number `3` and `2` and perform operations on it. The last element in the findings array is the finding itself.

This method is the most versatile of the `ast-monkey` because you can go "up the AST tree" by querying its array elements backwards.

### .get()

Use method `monkey.get()` to query AST trees by branch's index (a numeric id). You would get that index from a previously performed `monkey.find()` or you can pick a number manually, possibly choosing one of the indexes from `monkey.info()` output.

Practically, `monkey.get()` is typically used on each element of the findings array (which you would get after performing `find()`). Then, depending on your needs, you would write the particular index over using `monkey.set()` or delete it using `monkey.drop()`.

**Input**

Input argument   | Type                      | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------
`input`          | Whatever                  | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested.
`options`        | Object                    | yes         | Options object. See below.

Options object   | Type                      | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------
{                |                           |             |
`index`          | Number or number-as-string | yes        | Index number of piece of AST you want the monkey to retrieve for you.
}                |                           |             |

**Output**

The `monkey.get()` returns object, array or `null`, depending what index was matched (or not).

**Use example**

If you know that you want an index number two, you can query it using `monkey.get()`:

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var input = {
  a: {
    b: 'c'
  }
}
var index = 2
var result = monkey.get(input, {index: index})
console.log('result = ' + JSON.stringify(result, null, 4))
// => {
//      b: 'c'
//    }
```

In practice, you would query a list of indexes programmatically using a `for` loop.

### .set()

Use method `monkey.set()` to overwrite a piece of an AST with a known index.

---

**Input**

Input argument   | Type            | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------
`input`          | Whatever        | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested.
`options`        | Object          | yes         | Options object. See below.

Options object   | Type                       | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|----------------------------|-------------|-------------
{                |                            |             |
`index`          | Number or number-as-string | yes         | Index of the piece of AST to find and replace
`val`            | Whatever                   | yes         | Value to replace the found piece of AST with
}                |                            |             |

**Output**

Output           | Type             | Description
-----------------|------------------|--------------------
`input`          | Same as input    | The amended `input`

**Use example**

Let's say you identified the `index` of a piece of AST you want to write over:

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var input = {
  a: {b: [{c: {d: 'e'}}]},
  f: {g: ['h']}
}
var index = '7'
var val = 'zzz'
var result = monkey.set(input, {index: index, val: val})
console.log('result = ' + JSON.stringify(result, null, 4))
// => {
//      a: {b: [{c: {d: 'e'}}]},
//      f: {g: 'zzz'}
//    }
```

### .drop()

Use method `monkey.drop()` to delete a piece of an AST with a known index.

---

**Input**

Input argument   | Type                      | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------
`input`          | Whatever                  | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested.
`options`        | Object                    | yes         | Options object. See below.

Options object's key | Type                       | Obligatory? | Description
---------------------|----------------------------|-------------|-------------
{                    |                            |             |
`index`              | Number or number-as-string | yes         | Index number of piece of AST you want the monkey to delete for you.
}                    |                            |             |

**Output**

Output           | Type             | Description
-----------------|------------------|--------------------
`input`          | Same as `input`  | The amended `input`

**Use example**

Let's say you want to delete the piece of AST with an index number 8. That's `'h'`:

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var input = {
  a: {b: [{c: {d: 'e'}}]},
  f: {g: ['h']}
}
var index = '8' // can be integer as well
var result = monkey.drop(input, {index: index})
console.log('result = ' + JSON.stringify(result, null, 4))
// => {
//      a: {b: [{c: {d: 'e'}}]},
//      f: {g: []}
//    }
```

### .info()

Use method `monkey.info()` to list each index and its contents on the command line. It's mainly for testing purposes.

Let's create a file `testing.js` in the root of this library, at the same level where `index.js` is:

```js
'use strict'
const monkey = require('./index');
(function () {
  var input = {
    a: {b: [{c: {d: 'e'}}]},
    f: {g: ['h']}
  }
  monkey.info(input)
})()
```

That's basically an [IIFE](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch3.md) to consume `monkey.info()` function sitting at the same level (signed by `./`).

Then, in the command line, navigate to the same root folder where `testing.js` and `index.js` is and call it via node:

```bash
node testing
```

You'll get the listing of each index of the input:

```bash
-----------
    #1

key = "a"
val = {
    "b": [
        {
            "c": {
                "d": "e"
            }
        }
    ]
}
data.gatherPath = [
    1
]
-----------
    #2

key = "b"
val = [
    {
        "c": {
            "d": "e"
        }
    }
]
data.gatherPath = [
    1,
    2
]
-----------
    #3

key = {
    "c": {
        "d": "e"
    }
}
data.gatherPath = [
    1,
    2,
    3
]
-----------
    #4

key = "c"
val = {
    "d": "e"
}
data.gatherPath = [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4
]
-----------
    #5

key = "d"
val = "e"
data.gatherPath = [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5
]
-----------
    #6

key = "f"
val = {
    "g": [
        "h"
    ]
}
data.gatherPath = [
    6
]
-----------
    #7

key = "g"
val = [
    "h"
]
data.gatherPath = [
    6,
    7
]
-----------
    #8

key = "h"
data.gatherPath = [
    6,
    7,
    8
]
-----------
```

### .del()

Use method `monkey.del()` to delete all chosen key/value pairs from all objects found within an AST, or all chosen elements from all arrays.

---

**Input**

Input argument   | Type                      | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------
`input`          | Whatever                  | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested.
`options`        | Object                    | yes         | Options object. See below.

Options object's key  | Type             | Obligatory?                  | Description
----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|-------------
{                     |                  |                              |
`key`                 | String           | at least one, `key` or `val` | All keys in objects or elements in arrays will be selected for deletion
`val`                 | Whatever         | at least one, `key` or `val` | All object key/value pairs having this value will be selected for deletion
}                     |                  |                              |

If you set only `key`, any value will be deleted as long as `key` matches. Same with specifying only `val`. If you specify both, both will have to match, otherwise key/value pair (in objects) will not be deleted. Since arrays won't have any `val`ues, no elements in arrays will be deleted if you set both `key` and `val`.

**Output**

Output           | Type             | Description
-----------------|------------------|--------------------
`input`          | Same as `input`  | The amended `input`

**Use example**

Let's say you want to delete all key/value pairs from objects that have a key equal to 'c'. Value does not matter.

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var input = {
  a: {b: [{c: {d: 'e'}}]},
  c: {d: ['h']}
}
var key = 'c'
var result = monkey.del(input, {key: key})
console.log('result = ' + JSON.stringify(result, null, 4))
// => {
//      a: {b: [{}]}
//    }
```

### .arrayFirstOnly()

(ex-`flatten()` on versions `v.<3`)

`monkey.arrayFirstOnly()` will take an input (whatever), if it's traversable, it will traverse it, leaving only the first element within each array it encounters.

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var input = [
  {
    a: 'a'
  },
  {
    b: 'b'
  }
]
var result = monkey.arrayFirstOnly(input)
console.log('result = ' + JSON.stringify(result, null, 4))
// => [
//      {
//        a: 'a'
//      }
//    ]
```

In practice, it's handy when you want to simplify the data objects. For example, all my email templates have content separated from the template layout. Content sits in `index.json` file. For dev purposes, I want to show, let's say two products in the shopping basket listing. However, in production build, I want to have only one item, but have it sprinkled with back-end code (loop logic and so on). This means, I have to take data object meant for dev build, and flatten all arrays in the data, so they contain only the first element. `ast-monkey` comes to help.

**Input**

Input argument   | Type                      | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------
`input`          | Whatever                  | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested.

**Output**

Output           | Type             | Description
-----------------|------------------|--------------------
`input`          | Same as `input`  | The amended `input`

### .traverse()

This one is a bit advanced and more risky in wrong hands.

`traverse()` is an inner method used by other functions. It does the actual traversal of the AST tree (or whatever input you gave, from simplest string to most complex spaghetti of nested arrays and plain objects). This ~method~ function is used via a callback function, similarly to `Array.forEach()`.

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var ast = [{a: 'a', b: 'b'}]
ast = monkey.traverse(ast, function (key, val, innerObj) {
  // use key, val, innerObj
  return monkey.existy(val) ? val : key // (point #1)
})
```

Also, I like to use it this way:

```js
const monkey = require('ast-monkey')
var ast = [{a: 'a', b: 'b'}]
ast = monkey.traverse(ast, function (key, val, innerObj) {
  var current = monkey.existy(val) ? val : key
  // All action with variable `current` goes here.
  // It's the same name for any array element or any object key's value.
  return current // it's obligatory to return it, unless you want to delete that node
})
```

It's very important to **return the value on the callback function** (point marked `#1` above) because otherwise **you will change the input** (your AST). Maybe it's what you want, for example, functions `monkey.drop()` and `monkey.del()` work that way â€” they don't return anything when they encounter to-be-deleted piece upon traversal â€” that piece **gets deleted**.

By the way, the one-liner `existy()` is taken from Michael Fogus book "Functional JavaScript". It's the greatest snippet of all times (ok, `truthy()` is second, but `console.log('placeholder = ' + JSON.stringify(placeholder, null, 4))` is also a contender for the top spot).

## Unit testing and code coverage
