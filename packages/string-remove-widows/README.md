## Install

```bash
npm i string-remove-widows
```

Consume via a `require()`:

```js
const { removeWidows, defaultOpts, version } = require("string-remove-widows");
```

or as an ES Module:

```js
import { removeWidows, defaultOpts, version } from "string-remove-widows";
```

or for web pages, as a production-ready minified script file (so-called "UMD build"), straight from CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/string-remove-widows/dist/string-remove-widows.umd.js"></script>
```

```js
// in which case you get a global variable "stringRemoveWidows" which you consume like this:
const { removeWidows, defaultOpts, version } = stringRemoveWidows;
```

This package has three builds in `dist/` folder:

| Type                                                                                                    | Key in `package.json` | Path                               | Size  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----- |
| Main export - **CommonJS version**, transpiled to ES5, contains `require` and `module.exports`          | `main`                | `dist/string-remove-widows.cjs.js` | 17 KB |
| **ES module** build that Webpack/Rollup understands. Untranspiled ES6 code with `import`/`export`.      | `module`              | `dist/string-remove-widows.esm.js` | 17 KB |

## Idea

This library takes a string and removes [widow words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans), by replacing last space in the paragraph with [non-breaking space](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00a0/index.htm):

```html
Some text with many words on one&nbsp;line.
```

Also, optionally, it can replace spaces in front of dashes and between two parts of UK postcodes.

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

## Features

- Not just adds but if want, **removes** widow word prevention measures
- Tackles both paragraphs and single lines
- Recognises existing measures and if found, skips operation
- Option to encode for HTML, CSS or JS strings or put a raw non-breaking space
- Does not mangle the [line endings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1552775/3943954) (Mac `LF`, Old style `CR` or Windows-style `CR LF`)
- A customisable minimum amount of words per line/paragraph to trigger widow word removal
- Can be used in different stages of the workflow: before HTML/CSS/JS-encoding or after
- Optionally replaces spaces with non-breaking spaces in front of all kinds of **dashes**
- Optionally replaces spaces with non-breaking spaces within **UK postcodes**
- Optionally it can skip content between templating tags, for example, Nunjucks `{{` and `}}` — presets are given for Jinja, Nunjucks, Liquid, Hexo and Hugo

## API features

- This program is a "string-in — string-out" style function — decoupled from DOM, web pages or UI or CLI or terminal or file system. Build those on top of this program.
- This program delivers three builds: _UMD_ (for websites), _CommonJS_ (for Node applications) and _ES Modules_ (for modern Node applications and evergreen browsers too)

This program is used by [detergent.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detergent).

## Usage

```js
const { removeWidows } = require("string-remove-widows");
```

## API

When you `require`/`import`, you get three things:

```js
const { removeWidows, defaultOpts, version } = require("string-remove-widows");
```

`removeWidows` is a function which does all the work.

`defaultOpts` is a plain object, all the default options.

`version` is a semver string like `1.0.0` brought straight from `package.json`.

Here it is, in one place, in case you want to copy-paste it somewhere:

```js
{
  removeWidowPreventionMeasures: false, // if enabled this function overrides everything else
  convertEntities: true, // encode?
  targetLanguage: "html", // encode in what? [html, css, js]
  UKPostcodes: false, // replace space in UK postcodes?
  hyphens: true, // replace space with non-breaking space in front of dash
  minWordCount: 4, // if there are less words than this in chunk, skip
  minCharCount: 20, // if there are less characters than this in chunk, skip
  ignore: [], // list zero or more templating languages: "jinja", "hugo", "hexo", OR "all"
  reportProgressFunc: null, // reporting progress function
  reportProgressFuncFrom: 0, // reporting percentages from this number
  reportProgressFuncTo: 100, // reporting percentages up to this number
  tagRanges: []
}
```

### API - `removeWidows()` Output

Function `removeWidows` returns a plain object; you pick the values from it:

| Key in a returned object | Key value's type                      | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `res`                    | String                                | Processed string                                  |
| `ranges`                 | Array of zero or more ranges (arrays) | Calculated ranges used to produce the `res`       |
| `log`                    | Plain object                          | See its format below                              |
| `whatWasDone`            | Plain object                          | Was it widow removal or just decoding performed ? |

for example, here's how the output could look like:

```js
{
  res: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit&nbsp;amet",
  ranges: [
    [21, 27, "&nbsp;"]
  ],
  log: {
    timeTakenInMiliseconds: 42
  },
  whatWasDone: {
    removeWidows: true,
    convertEntities: false
  }
}
```

## More about `opts.targetLanguage`

Not all text ends up in HTML. As you know, you can inject the content via CSS pseudo attributes and also text might be prepared to be pasted into JSON.

This program allows you to customise the target encoding for chosen language: `html`, `css` or `js`.

Here's an HTML with HTML-encoded non-breaking space:

```html
Some raw text in a very long&nbsp;line.
```

Here's CSS analogue:

```css
span:before {
  content: "Some raw text in a very long\00A0line.";
}
```

Here's JavaScript analogue:

```js
alert("Some raw text in a very long\u00A0line.");
```

For example, a minimal application would look like this:

```js
const { removeWidows } = require("string-remove-widows");
// second input argument is a plain object, the Optional Options Object:
const result = removeWidows("Some raw text in a very long line.", {
  targetLanguage: "css"
});
// now the widow words will be prevented considering that content will go to CSS content:
console.log(result);
// => "Some raw text in a very long\00A0line."
```

## More about `opts.ignore`

Very often text already contains templating language literals.

For example, this Nunjucks snippet:

```nunjucks
Hi{% if data.firstName %} data.firstName{% endif %}!
```

We intend to either say `Hi John!` to customer John or just `Hi!` if we don't know the customer's name.

But if we run widow words removal on this piece of text, **we don't want** `&nbsp;` inserted into the middle of `endif`:

```nunjucks
Hi{% if data.firstName %} data.firstName{% endif&nbsp;%}!
                                                ^^^^^^
```

That's where `opts.ignore` comes in. You can list heads/tails (chunks from which to start ignoring/where to stop) manually:

```js
const { removeWidows } = require("string-remove-widows");
const result = removeWidows("Here is a very long line of text", {
  targetLanguage: "html",
  ignore: [
    {
      heads: "{{",
      tails: "}}"
    },
    {
      heads: ["{% if", "{%- if"],
      tails: ["{% endif", "{%- endif"]
    }
  ]
});
```

or you can just pick a template:

```
all
jinja
nunjucks
liquid
hugo
hexo
```

for example:

```js
const { removeWidows } = require("string-remove-widows");
const result = removeWidows("Here is a very long line of text", {
  targetLanguage: "html",
  ignore: "jinja"
});
```

If you want widest support of literals, all languages at once, put "all".

**[⬆ back to top](#)**

## opts.tagRanges

Sometimes input string can contain HTML tags. We didn't go that far as to code up full HTML tag recognition, more so that such thing would duplicate already existing libraries, namely, `string-strip-html` ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-strip-html), [monorepo](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/string-strip-html)).

`opts.tagRanges` accepts known HTML tag ranges (or, in fact, any "black spots" to skip):

```js
const strip = require("string-strip-html");
const { removeWidows } = require("string-remove-widows");

const input = `something in front here <a style="display: block;">x</a> <b style="display: block;">y</b>`;
// first, gung-ho approach - no tag locations provided:
const res1 = removeWidows(input).res;
console.log(res1);
// => something in front here <a style="display: block;">x</a> <b style="display:&nbsp;block;">y</b>
//                                                                               ^^^^^^
//                                      notice how non-breaking space is wrongly put inside the tag
//
// but, if you provide the tag ranges, program works correctly:
const tagRanges = stripHtml(input, { returnRangesOnly: true });
console.log(JSON.stringify(knownHTMLTagRanges, null, 4));
// => [[24, 51], [52, 56], [57, 84], [85, 89]]
// now, plug the tag ranges into opts.tagRanges:
const res2 = removeWidows(input, { tagRanges }).res;
console.log(res2);
// => something in front here <a style="display: block;">x</a>&nbsp;<b style="display: block;">y</b>
```

## Compared to competition on npm

In life, anything _professional_ (as opposed to _amateur_) means _an excess_.

🏋️ Professional weightlifting — _excessive_ weights by _normal peoples'_ standards.

👨‍🍳 Professional cooking — making 50 three-course dinners _at once_ — mildly speaking, _excessive_ — by "normal peoples" kitchen standards and so on.

📝 Professional preparing of marketing materials — websites and email templates — is also somewhat full of excesses. Millions of emails sent, hundreds of web pages managed, thousands of products listed. The more features your tool has, the more capabilities you have.

For example, you might need to copy some text from _PSD_, clean invisible characters, encode it in CSS, prevent widow words and paste it into pseudo-element in a .SCSS file. That's one click on [Detergent.io](https://detergent.io) and the **widow word prevention part** would be done by this program.

Supporting CSS and JS encoding besides only HTML is one of many features of this program which distinguishes it from the competition:

^ A _decoupled_ API means that at its core, the program is a function "_string-in, string-out_" and is not coupled with DOM, file I/O, network or other unrelated operations. Such API makes it easier to test and create many different applications **on top** of a decoupled API.

For example, our competitor [widow.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/widow-js) has two coupled parts: 1. API which does string-in, string-out, and 2. DOM processing functions. It could have been two npm libraries. In the end, people who don't need DOM operations can't use it.

One decoupled, "_string-in, string-out_" library like `string-remove-widows` might power all these at once:

- Web page DOM-manipulation library
- a CLI application to process files or piped streams
- an Express REST endpoint on a server,
- a serverless lambda on AWS,
- an Electron desktop program

Let's discuss it.
- If you tried to use this package, but something didn't work out, also [raise an issue](<https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?issue[title]=string-remove-widows%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here&issue[description]=**Which%20package%20is%20this%20issue%20for**%3A%20%0Astring-remove-widows%0A%0A**Describe%20the%20issue%20(if%20necessary)**%3A%20%0A%0A%0A%2Fassign%20%40revelt>). We'll try to help.
- If you want to contribute some code, fork the [monorepo](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/) via GitLab, then write code, then file a pull request on GitLab. We'll merge it in and release.

In monorepo, npm libraries are located in `packages/` folder. Inside, the source code is located either in `src/` folder (normal npm library) or in the root, `cli.js` (if it's a command-line application).

The npm script "`dev`", the `"dev": "rollup -c --dev --silent"` builds the development version retaining all `console.log`s with row numbers. It's handy to have [js-row-num-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-row-num-cli) installed globally so you can automatically update the row numbers on all `console.log`s.
