## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save object-flatten-all-arrays
```

## Purpose

This library recursively walks through the input (nested or not nested array, object, whatever) and look for arrays which are values in plain objects. Then it will scan contents of those arrays. If there are multiple plain objects inside, it will merge them.

In practice this library is used to extract the schema from a set of JSON files. The so called "schema" is the object which is has a superset of keys taken from one or many objects. Schema then can be matched across a set of JSON files â€” missing key/value pairs filled and all keys sorted.

## Use

```js
var flatten = require('object-flatten-all-arrays')
var object = {
  a: 'a',
  b: 'b',
  c: [
    {
      b: 'b',
      a: 'a'
    },
    {
      d: 'd',
      c: 'c'
    }
  ]
}
var flattened = flatten(object)
console.log('flattened = ' + JSON.stringify(flattened, null, 4))
// => {
// a: 'a',
// b: 'b',
// c: [
//   {
//     a: 'a',
//     b: 'b',
//     c: 'c',
//     d: 'd'
//   }
// ]}
```



## API

```js
flatten(input)
```

### API - Input

Input argument           | Type           | Obligatory? | Description
-------------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------
`input`                  | Whatever       | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested. Hopefully contains some plain objects.

## Testing

$ npm test
```
