## [3.0.0] - 2017-03-17
### Changed
- Recoded all the core, improving the algorithm and making everything cleaner (hope so).
- Pinned JS Standard not to be the latest, to avoid sudden linting issues coming from nowhere and blocking builds when a new version of JS Standard is released.

### Added
- Even more tests.

### Unchanged
- Unit test coverage is still a solid 100%.
