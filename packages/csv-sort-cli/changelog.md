## [1.6.0] - 2018-06-25

- âœ¨ Added unit tests
- ðŸŒµ Removed ava ESLint plugin until it's fixed for ESLint `v.5`

## [1.5.0] - 2018-06-21

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- âœ¨ Migrated to Bitbucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- âœ¨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis

## [1.4.0] - 2018-05-03

### Improvements

- âœ¨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- âœ¨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- âœ¨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code â€” Rollup will remove them during the builds.
- âœ¨ Stopped transpiling to ES5, dropped Babel and bumped the Node engines to `>=8`

## [1.3.0] - 2017-12-08

### Updated

- âœ¨ Serving transpiled code now. Node version requirements are way lower, not `6.8.0` as before. I test on Travis against Node `v.4` now.

## [1.2.0] - 2017-11-12

### Updated

- The to the latest API, v.2

## [1.1.0] - 2017-10-09

### Added

- Switched from JS Standard to raw ESLint on `airbnb-base` preset with semicolons off. Linting is way stricter now.
- Added second entry point when calling via CLI: `sortcsv`. Now you can call this library either via `sortcsv` or `csvsort`. Both names will work. Easier to remember.

## 1.0.0 - 2017-08-26
