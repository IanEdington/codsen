## [1.1.0] - 2017-10-09
### Added
- Switched from JS Standard to raw ESLint on `airbnb-base` preset with semicolons off. Linting is way stricter now.
- Added second entry point when calling via CLI: `sortcsv`. Now you can call this library either via `sortcsv` or `csvsort`. Both names will work. Easier to remember.
