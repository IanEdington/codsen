## 2.4.0 (2018-12-26)

- âœ¨ Rebase to point to es modules builds ([8d4635e](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/csv-sort/commits/8d4635e))

## 2.3.0 (2018-10-17)

- âœ¨ Updated all dependencies and restored unit test coverage tracking: reporting in terminal and coveralls.io

## 2.2.0 (2018-06-14)

GitHub sold us out. In the meantime, we:

- âœ¨ Migrated to BitBucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- âœ¨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis

## 2.1.0 (2018-05-03)

- âœ¨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- âœ¨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
- âœ¨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code â€” Rollup will remove them during the builds.

## 2.0.0 (2017-11-12)

- ðŸ”§ Rewrote in ES Modules and set up the Rollup to generate 3 flavours of it: CommonJS, UMD and ES Modules.

**PS.** Bumping major just in case the Rollup setup messes up somebody's API's (which it shouldn't but let's be on the safe side).

## 1.0.0 (2017-08-22)

- âœ¨ First public release
