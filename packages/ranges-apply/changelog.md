## [2.2.0] - 2018-05-11

### Improved

* âœ¨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* âœ¨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
* âœ¨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code â€” Rollup will remove from production code.
* âœ¨ Unit tests are pointing at ES modules build, which means that code coverage is correct now, without Babel functions being missed

## [2.1.0] - 2018-02-13

### Added

* âœ¨ Now accepts a single range as well, not only array of ranges.

## [2.0.0] - 2017-11-02

### Added

* âœ¨ The main source now is in ES2015 modules with `import`/`export`.
* âœ¨ Implemented Rollup to generate 3 flavours of this package: CommonJS, UMD and ESM `module` with `import`/`export`.

## [1.4.0] - 2017-09-19

### Changed

* ðŸ”§ Switching to ESLint on `airbnb-base` preset with semicolons-off override. JS Standard is rubbish because it's too relaxed and it's been using half-year-old ESLint. Actually it's even flagged as insecure by BitHound at the moment because of shell.js dependency two levels deep. ESLint itself is fine however.

### Removed

* Options, third input argument. It did nothing and I was expecting to add options, but now I don't want any. I removed the unused code related to options.

## [1.3.0] - 2017-08-30

### Changed

* ðŸ”§ OK, so after replacing ES6 template strings, the `let`s stopped minification of [emailcomb](https://emailcomb.com). I came up with idea to transpile the source to `/es5/index.js`, after publishing it should be available for consumption via `require('string-replace-slices-array/es5')`. Let's see how it goes.
* ðŸ”§ I restored all template strings as they were in `v1.1.0`.
* ðŸ”§ Tweaked the npm scripts, so ES5 version is generated as a pre-commit step.

## [1.2.0] - 2017-08-29

### Changed

* ðŸ”§ Guys, strange stuff. I was generating a production build of [emailcomb](https://emailcomb.com) and it refused to minify this library because of the first backtick in the ES6 template strings. So, I replaced them with ES5 code. Let's see how it will go. Geez!

## [1.1.0] - 2017-08-16

### Fixed

* ðŸ”§ Now allowing zeros as values in ranges too. Sorry about that, the integer-checking library was not accepting zeros. Fixed now.

## 1.0.0 - 2017-07-25

### New

* âœ¨ First public release
