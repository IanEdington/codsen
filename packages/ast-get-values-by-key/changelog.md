## [3.3.0] - 2018-05-02

### Added

* âœ¨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* âœ¨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`

## [3.1.0] - 2017-12-22

### Updated

* âœ¨ Tapped [`ast-monkey-traverse`](https://github.com/codsen/ast-monkey-traverse) directly. No need for the whole [`ast-monkey`](https://github.com/codsen/ast-monkey).

## [3.0.0] - 2017-12-14

### Updated

* âœ¨ Rebased in ES Modules
* âœ¨ Set up Rollup to generate three builds: a transpiled CommonJS, ES Modules and UMD.

The API is slightly relaxed now - you can set any types now. As long as you feed them as third argument and within array, it's fine. Previously, all values had to be string-type.
