## Install

```sh
$ npm i -S chlu
```

## What it does

`chlu` stands for CHangeLog Update. This library is the API for [`chlu-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chlu-cli). You probably want latter installed globally on your hard drive.

## Automatically updating changelogs

Your changelogs should follow the rules given by http://keepachangelog.com

However, sometimes errors happen and this tool will automatically fix them. Let me go through the most common errors (from my experience) in `changelog.md`:

### 1. Missing diff links in the footer for newly added titles.

This is the primary reason I created `chlu`. Often I clone the previous title and feature description, but forget to clone and edit the **title's link in the footer**. `chlu` will scan all titles and add the missing links in the footer.

For example, the culprit footer link would look like this:

```md
[1.4.0]: https://github.com/code-and-send/wrong-lib/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0
```

### 2. Wrong package

This has happened to me before, actually on Detergent's repo even. I copied and edited the changelog from my other library and forgot to edit the package name in the footer diff links. For example, `wrong-lib` is wrong below:

```md
[1.4.0]: https://github.com/code-and-send/wrong-lib/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0
```

`chlu` will read your `package.json` (which must be located at the same root folder as `changelog.md`) and fix both your GitHub user and GitHub package name in the links.

## Extras

Since the order of the features is descending, the default order of title markdown links in the footer should also be descending. That's also how example in http://keepachangelog.com is set. I hate that. Personally, I find it difficult to visually scan the list if the order is descending. That's why `chlu` will respect the existing order of your footer links and add the missing link in an order you've already got.
