## [2.10.0] - 2018-05-03

### Updated

### Added

* âœ¨ Set up [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* âœ¨ Removed `package.lock` and `.editorconfig`
* âœ¨ Wired Rollup to remove comments from non-dev builds. This means we can now leave the `console.log`s in the source code â€” Rollup will remove from production code.

## [2.9.0] - 2018-03-10

### Updated

* âœ¨ Switched from deprecated [posthtml-ast-contains-only-empty-space](https://github.com/codsen/posthtml-ast-contains-only-empty-space) to fresh [ast-contains-only-empty-space](https://github.com/codsen/ast-contains-only-empty-space)
* âœ¨ Updated all dependencies
* ðŸ’¥ Removing UMD build - nobody's gonna use this library in a browser

## [2.8.0] - 2018-01-23

### Added

* âœ¨ Test-fodder libraries' licences at the bottom of readme
* âœ¨ Updated all depdendencies

## [2.7.0] - 2017-12-08

### Improved

* âœ¨ Set up Rollup and now we generate 3 flavours: CommonJS, UMD and ES Modules. Source is now in ES Modules.

## [2.6.0] - 2017-11-27

### Changed

* âœ¨ Removed JS Standard and switched to raw ESLint on `airbnb-base` preset, with no-semicolons override.
* âœ¨ Since JS Standard is lagging on checks, I had to make some rebasing too.
* âœ¨ Tweaked the algorithm, specifically the part which identifies the titles (like `## [2.6.0] - 2017-11-27` above this bullet list, as opposed to the link lines in the footer). Now it's required for a title to have a `#` to be considered a title.

## [2.5.0] - 2017-07-23

### Added

* âœ¨ Now mixed marker dates such as `2014/04-20` are recognised. Updated unit tests accordingly. Thanks to [dehumanize-date](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/dehumanize-date/commit/7b4a27477a2bfdb614a4eb74c7972d5eea529480) by [forbeslindsay](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay).

## [2.4.0] - 2017-07-22

### Added

* âœ¨ Now when date in title is unrecognised, cleaning of the title will still happen: letter "v" in front of version digits will be removed (if it exists), whatever-date will be trimmed out of usual separators like minus, dash etc and separated by a single minus-dash.
* âœ¨ Did I mention, new erroneous title format `## v0.3.17 / 2016-03-23` is recognised and fixed automatically? It's letter `v` and/or dash separating the version and date.
* âœ¨ Copyrights and licences in README mentioning real-life changelogs used in unit tests.

### Changed

* All Lodash deps are now set to `*`, _the latest_.
* Removed bunch of irrelevant lines from unit test dummy package.json's
* Updated the documentation and licence with the up-to-date author name

## [2.3.0] - 2017-07-04

### Added

* âœ¨ Now supports `[YANKED]`, `YANKED`, `[yanked]` and `yanked` in the titles. Exactly as per [keepachangelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) spec.

## [2.2.0] - 2017-06-29

### Added

* âœ¨ Avoids false positives coming from semver pattern used within regular text
* âœ¨ Improved date extraction what will lead to less unrecognised dates in title

## [2.1.1] - 2017-06-28

### Added

* âœ¨ Added n-dash, m-dash, tab, comma, full stop and non-breaking space to the list of what's being trimmed after link titles. This means, bigger variation of non-standard titles would get recognised and there will be less chance that the remainder will not get recognised by `dehumanize-date`.

## [2.0.0] - 2017-06-26

### Changed

* âœ¨ Merged getRepoInfo and setRepoInfo. This might prevent some bugs when both algorithms are not the same. I anticipate to improve getter/setter algorithms in the future and it's easier when both are within the same function. The only difference between getter and setter is presence of second argument - if it's not provided, it's get. If it is, it's set.

### Added

* âœ¨ Footer link versions within GitHub magic diff links are validated and fixed if necessary. Fixes in include wrong versions (before and/or after), missing or multiple letters `v` before version and complete rubbish within any of the parts of the footer link (like text instead of diff link's version, in the URL).
* âœ¨ Empty lines between footer versions are deleted.
* âœ¨ Added safeguards against some edge cases where footer links are broken but in a sneaky way similar to real-ones, like `[3.0.0.]: whatever`. Now they're recognised and removed (and new-ones, correct-ones are generated if needed).

## [1.3.0] - 2017-06-23

### Added

* âœ¨ Now GitHub magic diff links will be added for all titles except the smallest version-one.
* âœ¨ Chlu will remove unused footer links. For now, only the links from recognised headers are cleaned (what should cover all normal use cases compliant with keepachangelog.com).

## [1.2.0] - 2017-05-19

### Added

* âœ¨ If the empty row above footer links is missing, it will be added.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-05-17

### Added

* âœ¨ Changelog. Ha!
* âœ¨ Improved the algorithm of adding missing links, case when mid-range links are missing now leaves footer links in a correct order.
* âœ¨ More unit tests to maintain a total 100% coverage.
* âœ¨ Improved readme

## 1.0.0 - 2017-05-16
