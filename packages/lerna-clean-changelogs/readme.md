## Install

```bash
npm i lerna-clean-changelogs
```

Default is exported so name the require/import anyway you want:

```js
import cleanChangelogs from "lerna-clean-changelogs";
// OR
const cleanChangelogs = require("lerna-clean-changelogs");
// THEN,
const preppedChangelog = cleanChangelogs("# Change Log...");
console.log(preppedChangelog);
```

Here's what you'll get:

| Type                                                                                                    | Key in `package.json` | Path                                 | Size |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Main export - **CommonJS version**, transpiled to ES5, contains `require` and `module.exports`          | `main`                | `dist/lerna-clean-changelogs.cjs.js` | 3 KB |
| **ES module** build that Webpack/Rollup understands. Untranspiled ES6 code with `import`/`export`.      | `module`              | `dist/lerna-clean-changelogs.esm.js` | 3 KB |
| **UMD build** for browsers, transpiled, minified, containing `iife`'s and has all dependencies baked-in | `browser`             | `dist/lerna-clean-changelogs.umd.js` | 2 KB |

## Idea

This is a string-in, string-out application which cleans strings, which hopefully are changelog file contents. We could say it is a low-level API for other cleaning tools: websites, CLI apps and whatnot.

If you want a ready-to-use _cleaning tool_, consider the sibling CLI application of this package (which is driven by this very package) — [lerna-clean-changelogs-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lerna-clean-changelogs-cli). Install it globally:

```bash
npm i -g lerna-clean-changelogs-cli
```

## API - Input

This package exports a function as a default, which means, you can name the `import` or `require` variable any way you like.

For example:

```js
import noodles from "lerna-clean-changelogs";
// now noodles() is the function into which you feed your changelog (as string).
```

**This function** you tapped accepts the following input arguments:

| Input argument | Key value's type | Obligatory? | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `str`          | String           | yes         | The input string of zero or more characters |

If the first input argument is not a string, an error will be thrown.
If the first input argument is an empty string it's fine; an empty string will be in the result.

This library is **deliberately decoupled from the file read/write operations** because we might want to put it on the web or to drive a CLI application using it or whatever. API as string-in, string-out^ is the most universal.

^ Actually, we export a plain object, where the result is under key "`res`" because we also export other information under other keys (such as version). However, the idea is the same - string-in, string-out.

## API - Output

The function exported under the key `crush` will return **a plain object** where you'll find log data, result string and corresponding string ranges of all actions performed:

| Key's name | Key value's type | Description                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`  | String           | Version as present currently in `package.json`. For example, `1.0.0` |
| `res`      | String           | The string you gave in the input, just cleaned.                      |

## Purpose

This package performs the following cleaning steps:

1. It removes bump-only changelog entries that `conventional-changelog` generates. There can be many reasons For example:

   ```
   **Note:** Version bump only for package ranges-apply
   ```

   These will be deleted along with their headings.

2. It removes diff links from headings. Change the following:

   ```
   ## [2.9.1](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply/compare/ranges-apply@2.9.0...ranges-apply@2.9.1) (2018-12-27)
   ```

   into:

   ```
   ## 2.9.1 (2018-12-27)
   ```

   We need to do that because those links don't work on BitBucket and, generally, are _a noise_.

3. Remove `h1` headings and turn them into `h2`, with the exception of the first, main heading of the changelog.

   For exampe, change the following:

   ```
   # [2.0.0](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/ranges-apply/compare/ranges-apply@2.0.0...ranges-apply@1.9.1) (2018-12-27)
   ```

   into:

   ```
   ## 2.0.0 (2018-12-27)
   ```

   (notice how a second hash character added, beside link being removed)

4. Replaces two or more empty lines into one line. `conventional-changelog` itself leaves excessive whitespace. As a bonus, if line only contains whitespace characters (spaces, tabs etc.) those whitespace characters are removed. They're hard to spot but useless.

5. If existing, pre-lerna changelog entries use dashes to note list items, those dashes are updated to match `conventional-changelog` notation using asterisks.

We might add more cleaning features in later releases.

## Updating it

When you install it globally, it will check occasionally, are there newer versions available, and if so, will show a message nagging you to update. It's the [same update notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/update-notifier) that AVA and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) themselves use!

## Contributing

- If you see an error, [raise an issue](https:/gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?title=lerna-clean-changelogs%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here).
- If you want a new feature but can't code it up yourself, also [raise an issue](https:/gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?title=lerna-clean-changelogs%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here). Let's discuss it.
- If you tried to use this package, but something didn't work out, also [raise an issue](https:/gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?title=lerna-clean-changelogs%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here). We'll try to help.
- If you want to contribute some code, fork the [monorepo](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/) via GitLab, then write code, then file a pull request on GitLab. We'll merge it in and release.

In monorepo, npm libraries are located in `packages/` folder. Inside, the source code is located either in `src/` folder (normal npm library) or in the root, `cli.js` (if it's a command line application).

The npm script "`dev`", the `"dev": "rollup -c --dev --silent"` builds the development version retaining all `console.log`s with row numbers. It's handy to have [js-row-num-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-row-num-cli) installed globally so you can automatically update the row numbers on all `console.log`s.
