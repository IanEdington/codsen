## Install

```bash
$ npm i -S json-comb-core
```

## Idea

Imagine, we have a set of objects (we just read few JSON files). We want to normalise those JSON files:

* Each object should have the same key set â€” missing keys should be added to each object.
* If an object has nested array, and there are plain objects within, each of those objects should have the same key set as its siblings within the same array.
* For the sake of completeness, let's sort each resulting object's keys too.

This library is meant to be used as a core for other libraries: plugins, front-end web apps or whatnot. It's DRY'er this way.

## getKeyset()

This function produces a reference object according to which you can normalise JSON files.

It reads an array of plain objects (parsed JSON files) and extracts a "schema keyset", a plain object, from them.

Technically speaking, a "schema keyset" is a superset of all objects. Two rules:

1. Each object of the same level between different JSON files should have same keys.
2. If array has objects, those objects should have exactly the same keys. If the array is a value and it is missing in a certain JSON, it gets filled with only one object.

The merging is done on a premise to retain [as much information](https://github.com/codsen/object-merge-advanced) after merging as possible.

### input

Input argument   | Type                   | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------
`input`          | Array of plain objects | yes         | AST tree, or object or array or whatever. Can be deeply-nested.
`options`        | Object                 | no          | Options object. See below.

`options` object's key         | Type     | Obligatory? | Default         | Description
-------------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------
{                              |          |             |                 |
`placeholder`                  | Any      | no          | `false` (bool.) | Instructs to skip all and any checks on these keys.
}                              |          |             |                 |

For example, keeping placeholder the default:

```js
var schema = getKeyset([
  { // < plain object No.1
    a: 'a',
    b: 'c',
    c: {
      d: 'd',
      e: 'e'
    }
  },
  { // < plain object No.2
    a: 'a'
  },
  { // < plain object No.3
    c: {
      f: 'f'
    }
  }
])
console.log('schema = ' + JSON.stringify(schema, null, 4))
// => {
//      a: false,
//      b: false,
//      c: {
//        d: false,
//        e: false,
//        f: false
//      }
//    }
```

Customising the placeholder:

```js
var schema = getKeyset([
    {
      a: 'a',
      b: 'c',
      c: {
        d: 'd',
        e: 'e'
      }
    },
    {
      a: 'a'
    },
    {
      c: {
        f: 'f'
      }
    }
  ],
  { placeholder: '' }
)
console.log('schema = ' + JSON.stringify(schema, null, 4))
// => {
//      a: '',
//      b: '',
//      c: {
//        d: '',
//        e: '',
//        f: ''
//      }
//    }
```

### ouput

A plain object, which can be used in `enforceKeyset()`. See below.

## enforceKeyset()

Reads an input plain object and a keyset schema object and normalises the input plain object

### input

Input argument | Type     | Obligatory? | Description
---------------|----------|-------------|--------------
`input`        | Object   | yes         | What should we normalise?
`schema`       | Object   | yes         | According to what schema should we normalise?

### ouput

A clone of an input object, with exactly the same key set as the `schema` object.

For example,

```js
var inputObj = {
  a: 'ccc'
}
var anotherObj = {
  a: 'aaa',
  b: 'bbb'
}
var schema = getKeyset([ inputObj, anotherObj ]) // <= notice both are fed via an array

inputObj = enforceKeyset( inputObj, schema )
console.log('inputObj = ' + JSON.stringify(inputObj, null, 4))
// => {
//      a: 'ccc',
//      b: false
//    }
```

## Unit testing and code coverage

```bash
$ npm test
```

Unit tests use [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and [JS Standard](https://standardjs.com) notation. Unit test code coverage is calculated using [Istanbul CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc).

## Difference between Normalising JSON and JSON Schemas

In short, JSON Schema concept is a way to define and enforce keys presence and/or their value types.

JSON file normalisation (what this library does, among other things) is making so that every JSON in a given set has exactly the same keys as all others. Missing values are simply set to a placeholder (normally Boolean `false`).

See the difference between the two concepts?

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Please stick to [Standard JavaScript](https://standardjs.com) notation and supplement the `test.js` with new unit tests covering your feature(s).
