# AVA

Regular AVA doesn't suit our needs so we have to tweak it a little bit:

* ðŸ”§ removed `import-local` from CLI first landing script to [make it work for Lerna](https://github.com/sindresorhus/import-local/issues/6)
* ðŸ’¥ new feature â€” if string `avaonly` is present in any of test files, that test file will be isolated â€” it saves time when running large projects with many test files
* ðŸ’¥ new feature â€” `.only` in any of the test files will isolate that file only. At the beginning AVA behaved that way until around v1, even if you added `.only` to an assertion on one file, it would still run other test files
* ðŸ”§ removed everything Typescript-related
* ðŸ”§ short-circuited its unit tests not to be ran, to save rounds when publishing real monorepo packages
* ðŸ”§ removed `react` from devDependencies â€” geez
* ðŸ”§ removed `updateNotifier` â€” it's not relevant any more
