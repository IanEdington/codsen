## Install

```bash
$ npm i -g chlu-cli
```

Yes, install globally. This is a CLI app.

## What it does

`chlu` stands for CHangeLog Update. Your changelogs should follow the rules given by http://keepachangelog.com. However, errors happen and `chlu` automatically and silently fixes known common errors in changelogs. Let me go through the most common mistakes (from my experience):

### 1. Missing diff URLs in the footer for newly-added titles

This is the primary reason I created `chlu`. Often I clone the previous title and feature description but forget to clone and edit the **title's link in the footer**. `chlu` will scan all titles and add the missing links in the footer. Working on the changelog of this very repo:

![](chlu_adds_missing_diff_links.gif)

Observe how I can delete footer links and they are restored by `chlu`! Magic!

In practice, this means your titles become actually linked (before/after example below):

### 2. Wrong package/user in the diff URL

This has happened to me before, actually on Detergent's repo even. I copied and edited the changelog from my other library and forgot to edit the package name in the footer diff links. For example, `PUT_A_WRONG_NAME_OF_THE_PACKAGE_HERE` below would get replaced by the correct name fresh from your `package.json`:

```md
[1.4.0]: https://github.com/code-and-send/PUT_A_WRONG_PACKAGE_HERE/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0
```

Same with wrong user names in the URL.

## Extras

Since the order of the features is descending, the default order of title Markdown links in the footer should also be descending. That's also how example in http://keepachangelog.com is set. I dislike that. Personally, I find it difficult to visually `grep` the links if they are in descending order. That's why `chlu` will respect the **existing** order of your footer links and add the missing link **in order you've already got**. If all your title links are missing, the default order is sensible _descending_. In the meantime, I'll keep my footer links in an _ascending_ order. Mwhuahaha!!
