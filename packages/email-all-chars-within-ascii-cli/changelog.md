## 1.5.0 (2018-08-17)

- ✨ Updated all dependencies
- ✨ Restored unit test linting

## 1.4.0 (2018-08-17)

- ✨ Migrated to BitBucket (to host repo + perform CI) and Codacy (for code quality audit)
- ✨ Dropped BitHound (RIP) and Travis
- ✨ Added unit tests. Finally! The API already had unit tests but CLI wrapper didn't. Now it has.

## 1.3.0 (2018-05-26)

- ✨ Removing transpiling. It's not relevant to modern machines running modern Node.
- ✨ Setup improvements - Prettier, removing `.package-lock` and other small bits

## 1.2.0 (2017-12-09)

- ✨ Set up transpiling. Not everybody will be using Node `6.8.0` and above so ES6 source code might be an issue. Now, transpiled version is served.

- ✨ Removed JS Standard and set up raw ESLint on `airbnb-base` config with semicolons turned off
