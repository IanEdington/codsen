## [1.3.0] - 2017-09-19
### Changed
- Switched to ESLint on `airbnb-base` preset with semicolons-off override. JS Standard sucks because it's not using as much rules as `airbnb` config and also JS Standard is being neglected by its maintainers - it's using half-year old ESLint dependency!

## [1.2.1] - 2017-09-01
### Removed
- Some inline `TODO` comments. They were actually redundant, the `unfancy` was already applied since `1.1.0
### Added
- A transpiled version in ES5 in `/es5/` folder.
- More badges in readme.

## [1.2.0] - 2017-08-07
### Added
- More unit tests. Everything indeed looks ok. So far. Knock knock knock on the wood.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-08-07
### Added
- âœ¨ `opts`. It goes with its train of options type enforcing using [check-types-mini](https://github.com/codsen/check-types-mini) to maintain the peace and sanity ðŸŒˆðŸ¦„.
- âœ¨ `opts.unfancyTheAltContents` is now on by default, but you can turn it off. It `trim`s your image ALT attribute contents and replaces all fancy characters with simpler equivalents. For example, curly quotes, m-dashes and so on. See the [string-unfancy](https://github.com/codsen/string-unfancy) which drives the replacement.

## 1.0.0 - 2017-08-05

- First public release
