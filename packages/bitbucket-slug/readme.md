**Update 2019-Feb-02**: I think **GitHub** are traitors because they sold out all open source developers and took M\$ money for our open source work. **GitHub** should have became like **Mozilla** - _a non-profit_. But hey, it's Capitalism. This leaves us with two alternatives: **BitBucket** and **GitLab**. I wanted to say **BitBucket** is ðŸ’© compared to **GitLab** and if you choose **BitBucket**, you'll suffer. For example, readme Table Of Contents's will work either on **BitBucket** or on **npm pages** but not on both. **BitBucket** support is ðŸ’© and they are not really coping with all their issues. **GitLab** is on the opposite, has 1 day lead times. Just sayin'.

## Install

```bash
npm i bitbucket-slug
```

then,

```js
const bSlug = require("bitbucket-slug");
```

or

```js
import bSlug from "bitbucket-slug";
```

Here's what you'll get:

| Type                                                                                                    | Key in `package.json` | Path                         | Size  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----- |
| Main export - **CommonJS version**, transpiled to ES5, contains `require` and `module.exports`          | `main`                | `dist/bitbucket-slug.cjs.js` | 878 B |
| **ES module** build that Webpack/Rollup understands. Untranspiled ES6 code with `import`/`export`.      | `module`              | `dist/bitbucket-slug.esm.js` | 725 B |
| **UMD build** for browsers, transpiled, minified, containing `iife`'s and has all dependencies baked-in | `browser`             | `dist/bitbucket-slug.umd.js` | 63 KB |

## Idea

BitBucket readme file headings are automatically linked with anchors.

This library generates those anchor links, just in case you want to generate a "**Table of Contents**" or programmatically generate links to any given BitBucket headings.

We backwards-engineered the BitBucket slug-generation algorithm, and it appears to be:

- Strip all punctuation (`.,;&`)
- Strip all emoji or non-letter characters (`ðŸ¦„`, `â™¥` and, for example)
- Strip hashes which mean Markdown headings and single space that follows them (`##`)
- Replace each chunk of spaces with single hyphen
- Deburr (`dÃ©jÃ  vu` -> `deja vu`; `Ä…Å¾uolas` -> `azuolas`)
- Strip non-latin letters (Cyrillic, Hiragana, Katakana etc.)

In BitBucket README's, there's a rule that no two slugs can be the same. If BitBucket slug-generation function generates the same URL, it starts to append `_1`, `_2` on the first repeated slug onwards.

There are only two dependencies: [ent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ent) to decode entities and [lodash.deburr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.deburr) to convert letters to basic Latin.

## Difference from existing slug-generation libraries

Whoever wonders, no, [slugify](https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify) won't match the BitBucket heading slug generation API. There are peculiarities which differ.

This library, on another hand, is aiming to match BitBucket spec as close as possible. Our unit tests are pinning the output of this library against the BitBucket-rendered HTML.

## Usage

```js
const bSlug = require("bitbucket-slug");

const res1 = bSlug(`## So-called "music"`);
console.log("res1 = " + JSON.stringify(res1, null, 4));
// => "markdown-header-so-called-music"

// works with encoded HTML:
const res2 = bSlug("## Some Lithuanian - Ä„Å¾uolynas");
console.log("res2 = " + JSON.stringify(res2, null, 4));
// => "markdown-header-some-lithuanian-azuolynas"
```

## API

API is simple: `string` in, `string` out.

If the input is `undefined` or `null` or not a string - empty string will be returned.

## Contributing

- If you see an error, [raise an issue](https:/gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?issue[title]=bitbucket-slug%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here&issue[description]=%23%23%20bitbucket-slug%0A%0Aput%20description%20here).
- If you want a new feature but can't code it up yourself, also [raise an issue](https:/gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?issue[title]=bitbucket-slug%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here&issue[description]=%23%23%20bitbucket-slug%0A%0Aput%20description%20here). Let's discuss it.
- If you tried to use this package, but something didn't work out, also [raise an issue](https:/gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/issues/new?issue[title]=bitbucket-slug%20package%20-%20put%20title%20here&issue[description]=%23%23%20bitbucket-slug%0A%0Aput%20description%20here). We'll try to help.
- If you want to contribute some code, fork the [monorepo](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/) via GitLab, then write code, then file a pull request on GitLab. We'll merge it in and release.

In monorepo, npm libraries are located in `packages/` folder. Inside, the source code is located either in `src/` folder (normal npm library) or in the root, `cli.js` (if it's a command line application).

The npm script "`dev`", the `"dev": "rollup -c --dev --silent"` builds the development version retaining all `console.log`s with row numbers. It's handy to have [js-row-num-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-row-num-cli) installed globally so you can automatically update the row numbers on all `console.log`s.
