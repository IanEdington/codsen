## [1.5.0] - 2017-06-11
### Changed
- üîß Fixed a bug involving `null` values. I overused `existy()`, in this case, using it to check existence of a key in an Object. The right way is to use `.hasOwnProperty`. Silly me. {facepalm}
- üîß Now `opts.enforceStrictKeyset` checks both ways, the keysets of both object and reference object have to match _strictly_. Previously I tried to cheat and check only one direction, assuming the object will be `object-assign`'ed from the reference. But this morning I was thinking, what it isn't? For me it's easy to close this error rabbit-hole, so let's do it.

## [1.4.0] - 2017-06-10
### Added
- ‚ú® `opts.enforceStrictKeyset` will now by default `throw` if there are any keys in the options object, that don't exist in the reference object.

## [1.3.0] - 2017-05-22
### Added
- ‚ú® `opts.acceptArrays` will accept arrays too, if they contain only the same type elements as the one that's being checked.
- ‚ú® `opts.acceptArraysIgnore` - lets you ignore per-key level when `opts.acceptArrays` is on. üëç

## [1.2.0] - 2017-05-15
### Added
- `opts.ignoreKeys` won't throw now if input is a single string.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-05-15
