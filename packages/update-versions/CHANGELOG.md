## 2.0.0 (2019-09-23)

### Features

- don't touch existing package.json formatting ([c51782e](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/commit/c51782e))
- recode fully in async ([a3adac5](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/commit/a3adac5))

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Full recode

## 2.0.0 (2019-09-22)

### Improvements

- Fully recoded all operations to be in async and with full progress tracking.
- If package "a" consumes dependency package "b" and the "b" exists on the monorepo, we set "a" package.json version for "b" to be `version` from local "b" package.json. We don't even query npm. For example, we have our own bastardised `ava`, frozen in time at `v2.2.5` which is consumed by all monorepo packages, instead of npm's `v2.4.0` (at the time of writing).
- Removed dependencies `write-json-file` and `format-package` because now we edit JSON as string using `edit-package-json` ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/edit-package-json), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/codsen/codsen/tree/master/packages/edit-package-json/)). Now we don't touch the formatting of each `package.json` - its indentation or whatever.
